# Deep Euler Method Tests
Codes for testing the Deep Euler Method. The Deep Euler Method is a numerical integration scheme which takes advantage of a neural network to approximate the local truncation error of the Euler Method. By adding the approximation to the Euler-step a higher order solution is achieved.

The same scheme was proposed in the paper [Hypersolvers: Toward Fast Continuous-Depth Models](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/f1686b4badcf28d33ed632036c7ab0b8-Abstract.html)
